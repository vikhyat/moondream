def fourier_features(x: torch.Tensor, w: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    """
    Applies Fourier feature mapping to input tensor x using frequency matrix w. This
    projects inputs through sinusoidal functions to create higher dimensional features
    that help mitigate spectral bias - the tendency of neural networks to learn
    low-frequency functions more easily than high-frequency ones. By explicitly
    mapping inputs to higher frequencies through sin/cos transformations, we enable
    better learning of fine details and higher frequency patterns.

    Args:
        x: Input tensor to transform
        w: Matrix of frequencies for the Fourier features transformation

    Returns:
        Concatenated cosine and sine transformed features as a tensor
